Coding challenge from Bi** 

**Note**: I couldn't find the complete solution as requested in requirement 3. I have struggled to get mast counts in one group for EverythingEverywhere Ltd & Hutchinson3GUK Ltd. I used RegEx to group them in one group, but could not succeed. Apologies for this unsolved issue.
